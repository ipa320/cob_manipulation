## @package interpolated_ik_motion_planner
# Server to provide interpolated IK motion plans
# relevant params:
# num_steps: the number of steps to use when interpolating including start and finish (0 means use pos_spacing and 
#     rot_spacing to calculate the number of steps, anything ==1 or <0 will become 2, start and finish)
# consistent_angle: the max angle distance (in any joint) before we declare that the path is inconsistent
# collision_check_resolution: how many steps between collision checks (0 or 1 is check every step; 2 is every other, etc.)
# steps_before_abort: the number of steps in the plan (starting from the end and going backwards) that can be invalid 
#     due to collisions or inconsistency before aborting (0 is abort as soon as you find one, 1 is allow one and still 
#     continue, -1 or >=num_steps to never abort early)
# pos_spacing: the max translation (m) to move the wrist between waypoints (only used if num_steps is 0)
# rot_spacing: the max rotation (rad) to move the wrist between waypoints (only used if num_steps is 0)
# collision_aware: if this is 0, collisions won't be checked for (returns non-collision aware IK solutions)
# start_from_end: if this is 1, the planner searches for an IK solution for the end first, then works backwards from there
# max_joint_vels: a list of maximum joint velocities to use when computing times and velocities for the joint trajectory (defaults to [.2]*7 if left empty)
# max_joint_accs: a list of maximum accelerations to use when computing times and velocities for the joint trajectory (defaults to [.5]*7 if left empty)

# Parameters can be changed by calling the r_interpolated_ik_motion_plan_set_params service (or l_inter...)


# The main service message is GetMotionPlan.srv, in arm_navigation_msgs.  Parts that were hijacked 
# for the relevant inputs and outputs:

# inputs:
# req.motion_plan_request.start_state.joint_state.name: the names of the arm joints in order (defaults to those provided by IKQuery, if not specified)
# req.motion_plan_request.start_state.joint_state.position: a set of joint angles to stay sort of close to if possible (defaults to current joint angles if not specified)

# req.motion_plan_request.start_state.multi_dof_joint_state.pose: the start pose for the r_wrist_roll_link
# req.motion_plan_request.start_state.multi_dof_joint_state.child_frame_id: the link to put at that pose (better be 'r_wrist_roll_link' or 'l_wrist_roll_link')
# req.motion_plan_request.start_state.multi_dof_joint_state.frame_id: the frame for the start pose

# req.motion_plan_request.goal_constraints.position_constraints[0].position: the (x,y,z) goal position of the same link as the start pose
# req.motion_plan_request.goal_constraints.position_constraints[0].header.frame_id: the frame that goal position is in
# req.motion_plan_request.goal_constraints.orientation_constraints[0].orientation: the (x,y,z,w) goal orientation of the same link as the start pose
# req.motion_plan_request.goal_constraints.orientation_constraints[0].header.frame_id: the frame that goal orientation is in

# req.motion_plan_request.workspace_parameters.ordered_collision_operations: the list of collision operations to modify the collision space
# req.motion_plan_request.link_padding: links and collision-space padding to change from the default dynamically

# outputs:
# res.trajectory.joint_trajectory.joint_names: the arm joint names in the normal order, as spit out by IKQuery
# res.trajectory.joint_trajectory.points: a list of JointTrajectoryPoints whose 'positions' fields are lists of joint angles in a trajectory that gets you from start to goal (positions will be all 0s if a point on the path is out of reach),
# 'velocities' fields are reasonable joint velocities, and 'time_from_start' fields are reasonable times to get to each waypoint. ('accelerations' will be empty.)
# res.trajectory_error_codes: a list of ArmNavigationErrorCodes messages the same length as the trajectory, 
# with values for each trajectory point as follows:
# ArmNavigationErrorCodes.SUCCESS (1): no problem
# ArmNavigationErrorCodes.COLLISION_CONSTRAINTS_VIOLATED (-23): no non-colliding IK solution (colliding solution provided)
# ArmNavigationErrorCodes.PATH_CONSTRAINTS_VIOLATED (-20): inconsistency in path between this point and the next point
# ArmNavigationErrorCodes.JOINT_LIMITS_VIOLATED (-21): out of reach (no colliding solution)
# ArmNavigationErrorCodes.PLANNING_FAILED (-1): aborted before getting to this point

# Everything else is completely ignored.
